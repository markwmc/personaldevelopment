interview question #32
whats the difference between an ajax request and axios call?
  nothing, underneath they both make ajax request.

interview question #39
how do i know if something bad or good happens inside of my promises/function?
	if the original request returns something in the 200s, then .then() will fire. otherwise, the catch will fire.
	
	
	
	
	
	entitiesService
            .getById(newFormData)
            .then(onGetByIdEntitySuccess)
            .catch(onGetByIdEntityError);
			
		Add a Form element to the page.
Add at least 1 form field and form field label to the Form
Make sure the form renders well and is not stuck to the default side of the page.
Add the remaining fields to the form.
Ensure all fields have a class name or Id attribute so that I can select it via JavaScript
Add a Button to the form
Wire up a click handler to the button and make sure the button click fires this function
Create a function that reads from data
When the Button is clicked, the click handler calls the function that reads the form data
Create an ajax function that hits the POST endpoint (post since we are adding) and test this function works with hardcoded data
Make the Ajax function work with the dynamic data (data from the form)
Show the user some feedback about the operation succeeded or not.
